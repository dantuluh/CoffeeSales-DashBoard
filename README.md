☕ Coffee Orders Data Analysis

📌 Overview
Hey there! This is a data analysis project based on a coffee orders dataset I got from Kaggle. The goal was simple—clean the data, merge multiple sheets, and analyze the trends using Excel. I played around with XLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, and created pivot tables, charts, and visualizations to make sense of the data.
